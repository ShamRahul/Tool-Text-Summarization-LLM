# 🦜🔗 LLM-Text Summarization Prototyping Tool

This project serves as a quick prototyping tool for text summarization, leveraging the power of OpenAI, LangChain, and Streamlit. It is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to easily input text and receive summarized responses, making it a valuable tool for those looking to experiment with text summarization models.

## 🌟 Features
- **OpenAI Integration**: Utilizes the latest OpenAI models for accurate text summarization.
- **LangChain**: Leverages LangChain for efficient text processing and summarization chain creation.
- **Streamlit App**: Provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction and quick prototyping.
- **Text Splitting**: Efficiently handles long texts by splitting them into manageable chunks before processing.
